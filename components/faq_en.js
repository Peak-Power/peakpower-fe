        title: "PEAK POWER IN A NUTSHELL?",
        content: "Peak Power drives energy asset ROI by enabling participation in energy markets, multiplying and optimizing the asset revenue streams. Peak Power supports energy asset owners and investors alike to operate and utilise asset capacities more efficiently, across markets and fully automated. Through big data, market forecasting, smart decision making and our next generation Virtual Power Plant (VPP). Peak Power realises its solution by filling an integrator role in the energy industry between battery suppliers, the energy markets and investors and linking the parties with its proprietary Peak Power Optimization Engine.",

        title: "WHAT IS FLEXIBILITY FOR YOU? DO YOU MARKET IT?",
        content: "Flexibility is often referred to the flexibly available capacity in an Asset. If this asset is a battery or any other energy asset does not matter here. Peak Power understands flexibility from a different angle, rather as the ability of an asset to operate differently than in its status quo. This means operating across more markets than today at a higher utilisation than today, with more realised market opportunities. In that sense Peak Power does market flexibility, both the flexibly available capacity of an asset (with or without restrictions such as peak shaving) and increasing the ability of an asset to operate cross-market.

        title: "DO YOU OPERATE AS A DIRECT MARKETER / DIREKTVERMARKTER?",
        content: "Peak Power also operates as a direct marketer. This offers the opportunity for Electricity producers, such as Wind and PV operators, to join the Peak Power Pool. ",

    //     title: "WHAT DO YOU DO DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PLAYERS SUCH AS NEXT-KRAFTWERKE?",
    //     content: "Peak Power differentiates in several key approaches from Next-Kraftwerk. 1) Peak Power's envisioned asset pool structure is geared towards grid scale battery energy storage assets (BESS) with a minority share of energy production assets such as PV, Wind and Biogas. The focus on storage increases pool flexibility in terms of realisingmarket opportunities in a flexible manner. 2) being the focus on optimization across all markets. ",

    // {
    //     title: "HOW IS YOUR SOLUTION BETTER THAN OTHERS?",
    //     content: "Peak Power's competitive edge is in the flexibilisation of assets across all available markets and its pool focus on storage assets. With our 3rd generation VPP, we are able to create greater pool synergies than pools with either no specific asset focus or with a focus on small scale behind-the-meter assets. Since Peak Power operates the asset directly through the energy management system (EMS), Peak Power can take the best market opportunities in an instant manner, Overall however we do believe that the energy market will and need to be transformed by multiple companies, solving the big challenges we face from different angles at the same time. ",

    {
        title: "WHAT IS YOUR TECHNOLOGY EDGE?",
        content: "The main challenge in optimizing assets across markets is optimising around  commercial and technical restrictions - due to market design, asset set-up and operational mode. The EPEX Day-Ahead and Intraday market for instance does imply low retrictions in terms of liquidity and tradability. Acting on the demand driven balancing markets that are less liquid in the contrary however implies higher restrictions and a risk, not to be activated with energy by the TSO. Managing those conditions in an automated manner through Peak Power's intelligent system isthe core technology edge. ",

    {
        title: "HOW DO YOU EARN MONEY?",
        content: "Peak Power operates with a revenue sharing model based on the asset revenues that we create through marketing the asset. When operating a production unit, we operate on a commission basis per MWh traded. ",

    {
        title: "DO YOU PRODUCE BATTERIES?",
        content: "Peak Power does not produce batteries. However, Peak Power has built strategic alliances with battery suppliers and EPCs to leverage battery rollout as a route to market to position for scaling. ",
    },
    {
        title: "DO YOU DEPLOY BATTERIES?",
        content: "Peak Power supports the deployment of batteries in close alignment with investors and other stakeholders to leverage rollout as a route to market. Those batteries are thereafter operated in the Peak Power pool. ",
    },
    {
        title: "WHAT IS THE LIFETIME OF A BATTERY?",
        content: "The battery life highly depends on the number of cycles it is going through. Batteries have a lifetime of approx. 6-7 years at an average operation through the Peak Power optimization with an amotisation after 2-4 years. ",
    },
    {
        title: "WHAT ARE TYPICAL PEAK POWER CUSTOMERS?",
        content: "Peak Power looks at three main customer groups. 1) Farmers and BÃ¼rgerenergiegesellschaften / renewable energy communities, that do have existing assets or intend to deploy assets that need to be operated and optimized, 2) infrastructure investors that look at deploying capital into the energy industry, 3) DSOs / Stadtwerke, that need short term and/or planned energy services to clear their balance circle and shave peaks in their system. ",

    {
        title: "BATTERIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR BAD ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL FOOTPRINT. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS?",
        content: "Peak Power is aware of the environmental impacts of battery manufacturing and has a strong drive to minimize the footprint of technology it works with. For this reason we are actively engaging battery suppliers using other technologies or approaches than conventional manufacturing of new battery cells and systems. To foster the circular economy, Peak Power has teamed up with a manufacturer of stationary systems from EV cells as well as with a manufacturer of compressed air batteries. On the side of new battery cells latest chemical battery technologies such as LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) are less impactful to the environment than other chemical battery technologies (by not using heavy metals or toxic materials). Peak Power focuses on this technology where possible to reduce the negative impact from the materials used in batteries we operate. ",

    {
        title: "HOW DO YOU INTEND TO SCALE? WHAT IS YOUR ROUTE TO MARKET?",
        content: "Peak Power intends to scale via two main channels. Firstly through strategic alliances with battery suppliers, and by creating an additional customer value proposition (CVP) as an onboard solution to new batteries. Secondly through deployment of own systems once the Peak Power pool has reached a reasonable size. ",

        title: "THE IMBALANCES HAVE GONE DOWN OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS BECAUSE FORECASTING HAS IMPROVED. HOW DO YOU SEE THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES DEVELOPING OVER THE NEXT YEARS?",
        content: "Peak Power believes that business opportunities will remain attractive over the next decade with a factor of 20-50x storage alone to come on stream. With more renewables and storage deployed and forecasting to improve, opportunities in the market will decrease in the very long run. Prior to this point Peak Power intends to branch out into regional energy services offered through the built asset pool . ",

    {
        title: "WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST THREAT?",
        content: "The energy industry is highly complex and dynamic and so is the development of regulations. What Peak Power observes in the market today is a high degree of uncertainty amongst market participants such as operators and infrastructure investors due to the complex regulatory environment. This implies a higher level of project termination  risk compared to other industries. Peak Power copes with this threat by building a solution that is both asset agnostic and flexible towards regulatory changes as well as forming strategic alliances to support a solid route to market.

    //     title: "HOW ARE YOU SPENDING FUNDS INVESTED INTO PEAK POWER?",
    //     content: "We appreciate the energy industry being a highly regulated field with long sales cycles and dynamic changes in the market environment. For this reason we consciously build a reasonably sized team to focus on the value adding arts of the business. Funds will be distributed approx. 80% to the team with half of it going into the tech development and 20% in infrastructure and overhead. ",
